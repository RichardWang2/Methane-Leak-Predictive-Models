# Methane-Leak-Predictive-Models
A research project on methane leak rates I did when I TA'ed for a data science undergraduate course in UC Berkeley.
<br><br>
This research is originally conducted to see if the course staffs may improve one of the homework in the course. The original homework only has data from CalEnviroScreen. We would like to add another dataset and merge it with the CalEnviroScreen dataset, and use a feature from our new dataset as the target variable.
<br><br>
In the end, this new interation of the homework was not implemented in the course, but I continued on the project. My goal in this research was to find the best set of features that predicts methane leakage rate, so in the future when people try to prevent methane leakage, they can use these set of features as a starting point.
<br><br>
After feature selection, I used machine learning models such as random forests, XGBoost, and a MLP Neural Network to try to predict methane leak rates. After hyperparameter tuning using correlation heat maps, I ended up with decent results with all three of the models. In the end, I discovered 14 useful features for predicting methane leak rates.

Please give this research project a read, I have linked the paper in the repository. Thank you!
